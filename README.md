git clone git@github.com:ReadyMouse/sir-clicks-a-lot.git
cd sir-clicks-a-lot
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install

### Build the Project

To compile the TypeScript source code:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Run the Web Interface

#### For Development (auto-reloads on changes):
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
This uses `ts-node-dev` and is best while you're actively developing.

#### For Production (runs the compiled JavaScript):
```bash
pnpm start
```
This uses `ts-node` to run your server.

After running either command, your web interface will be available at:
**http://localhost:3000**
